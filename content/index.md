# Current project

I'm currently working on [type-driven data-science infrastructure for Idris2](https://vetss.org.uk/type-driven-data-science-infrastructure-for-idris2/), supported by the [National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/), as part of the [UK Research Institute in Verified Trustworhy Software Systems](https://vetss.org.uk/), led by [Ohad Kammar](https://www.denotational.co.uk/), at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/).

As part of this project, I have:

- Contributed to [Idris 2](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2).
- Created the [Idris 2 Python backend](https://github.com/madman-bob/idris2-python).
- Created the [Idris 2 Jupyter kernel](https://github.com/madman-bob/idris2-jupyter).
- Created a [VegaLite plugin](https://github.com/madman-bob/idris2-jupyter-vega) for the Jupyter kernel.
- Created a tool to generate [Idris 2 types from a JSON Schema](https://github.com/madman-bob/idris2-json-schema).
- Created an Idris 2 [XML library](https://github.com/madman-bob/idris2-xml).
- Created an Idris 2 [LibreOffice file manipulation library](https://github.com/madman-bob/idris2-odf).
- Created an Idris 2 [Table library](https://github.com/madman-bob/idris2-table).

# Talks

## Idris Data Science Infrastructure

An introduction to a number of tools supporting data science work in Idris. We will talk about tools for extracting data from businesses, presenting results to stakeholders, and other tools that were developed in the course of developing these tools.

This is the surrounding work, we wont directly do any data science.

Presented to the Idris Community Discord server during the December 2021 Idris Developer Meetup.

## Extending RefC

Writing backends is time-consuming, and most languages have C FFIs, so wouldn't it be nice if we could just use the C backend instead? In this talk I show how to extend RefC to create Idris 2 backends for more languages, by a high-level overview of the Python backend.

No Python knowledge will be required, we will be staying mostly in Idris code. This talk should be useful both if you want to get involved in the Python backend, or if you want to create another RefC-based backend.

Presented to the Idris Community Discord server as the September 2021 monthly talk.
