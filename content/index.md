# Current project

I'm currently working on [type-driven data-science infrastructure for Idris2](https://vetss.org.uk/type-driven-data-science-infrastructure-for-idris2/), supported by the [National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/), as part of the [UK Research Institute in Verified Trustworhy Software Systems](https://vetss.org.uk/), led by [Ohad Kammar](https://www.denotational.co.uk/), at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/).

As part of this project, I have:

- Contributed to [Idris 2](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2).
- Created the [Idris 2 Python backend](https://github.com/madman-bob/idris2-python).
- Created the [Idris 2 Jupyter kernel](https://github.com/madman-bob/idris2-jupyter).
- Created a [VegaLite plugin](https://github.com/madman-bob/idris2-jupyter-vega) for the Jupyter kernel.
- Created a tool to generate [Idris 2 types from a JSON Schema](https://github.com/madman-bob/idris2-json-schema).
- Created an Idris 2 [XML library](https://github.com/madman-bob/idris2-xml).
- Created an Idris 2 [LibreOffice file manipulation library](https://github.com/madman-bob/idris2-odf).
- Created an Idris 2 [Table library](https://github.com/madman-bob/idris2-table).
